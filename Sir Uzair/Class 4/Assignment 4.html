    <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction to Global Warming</h1>
    <p>
        Global warming is a pressing environmental issue characterized by the long-term increase in Earth's average
        surface temperature. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, contribute
        significantly to the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.

    <p>
        Global warming poses a severe threat to our planet's ecosystems, biodiversity, and overall climate stability.
        Understanding its causes and effects is paramount to devising effective solutions and promoting a sustainable
        future.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Causes">Causes of Global Warming</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Burning of Fossil Fuels: The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas releases greenhouse gases such as
            carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Deforestation: The clearing of forests reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO2, contributing to
            higher concentrations in the air.</li>
        <li>Industrial Activities: Certain industrial processes release potent greenhouse gases, intensifying the
            greenhouse effect.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="Effects">Effects on the Environment</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rising Sea Levels: Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to higher sea levels, threatening coastal
            areas.</li>
        <li>Extreme Weather Events: Increased temperatures lead to more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and
            other extreme weather phenomena.</li>
        <li>Disruption of Ecosystems: Changes in temperature and weather patterns impact plant and animal species,
            affecting biodiversity.</li>
        
    </ol>

   

    <h2 id="FutureOutlook">Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>
        The future outlook for global warming depends on our collective efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
        adopt sustainable practices, and implement effective policies to address this critical environmental
        challenge.
